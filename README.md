金星文：金星与众不同地逆行自转，你的文字也可以。

VenusCode: Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation, so do this code.

## Description
与[火星文](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%81%AB%E6%98%9F%E6%96%87)不同，金星文改变的是文字排序的方式。在不影响人类阅读的情况下，干扰机器的对信息的检索和识别。一定程度上能减少算法对文字内容的监控，保护信息隐私。

By simply rearranging the way characters forming words and sentences, you can mess up with machines while keep your messages human-readable. It's mainly designed to bypass machine-based censorship such as [Wordfilter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordfilter) in [WeChat](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/) or [Weibo](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/11/tracing-path-censored-weibo-post-compiling-keywords-trigger-automatic-review/). It could also be helpful to reduce on-line tracking, since algorithms can not search or understand your messages in the normal way.

Note: This is different from [Martian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_language).

## implementation
Currently available in Java and JS. This is more of a coding practice for me so I would try to implement it using other languages.
